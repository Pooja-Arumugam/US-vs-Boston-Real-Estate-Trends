### US vs Boston Real Estate Trends
This project provides an in-depth comparison of real estate trends in the United States and Boston, focusing on pricing patterns, affordability, and investment opportunities. Using Python for analysis and Tableau for visualization, the project uncovers key insights into housing market behavior across different timelines and geographies.

## Key Visualizations
Price trends over time: US vs Boston

Affordability Index comparisons

Rent vs Sale value 

Top expensive & affordable neighborhoods in Boston

Forecast analysis using moving averages

## Project Workflow
Data Cleaning: Removed nulls, standardized date formats, and merged multiple sources.

Exploratory Data Analysis: Identified pricing trends and regional differences using descriptive statistics and visualizations.

Comparison: Built dashboards to compare Boston metrics with national averages.

Insights:

Boston consistently ranks among the least affordable cities in the US.

Price appreciation in Boston outpaces the national average post-2020.
